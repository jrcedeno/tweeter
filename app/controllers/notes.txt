Flow control -> controller 
Business logic -> model 

The controller does things
The model knows things 

Extra code in the model that relates to the actions defined in the controller 

In the model youd put:
has_many
belongs_to

[magaizne.rb(model)]
class Magazine < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :ads
end

ad.rb(model) 
class Ad < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :magazine
end


would be 

[routes.rb]
resources :magazine do
  resources :ads
end
